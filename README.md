### malloc() vs new():

`malloc()`: It is a C library function that can also be used in C++, while the “`new`” operator is specific for C++ only. 
 
Both `malloc()` and new are used to allocate the memory dynamically in heap. But “`new`” does call the constructor of a class whereas “`malloc()`” does not.

### free() vs delete: 

`free()` is a C library function that can also be used in C++, while “`delete`” is a C++ keyword.
`free()` frees memory but doesn’t call Destructor of a class whereas “`delete`” frees the memory and also calls the Destructor of the class.
